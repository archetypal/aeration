# Resource Innovation Life Cycle
*[{{ page.maturity }}](lifecycle.md#{{ page.maturity }}) {{ page.content_type }} by {{ page.author }} v{{ page.version }}*

## TL;DR

The resource innovation life cycle describes the practice of innovating, recommending, and adopting a new or modified resource (principle, practice, guide, specification, archetype, etc.).  This lifecycle is a [resource](resource.md) itself.

The maturity levels of a resource are:
- [Strawman](#strawman)
- [Draft](#draft)
- [Proposed](#proposed)
- [Recommended](#recommended)
- [Retired]($retired)


## Strawman

The *Strawman* designation indicates that the resource is being researched (in [discovery](innovation.md#discover)) and is being put forth to generate discussion of its advantages and disadvantages in order to create new and better proposals.  The resource is not well defined, will change, and should **not** be used by others at this time. 

A strawman will have restricted access.

## Draft

The *Draft* designation indicates that the resource is being [shaped](innovation.md#shape), but may not ready to be prototyped or validated by others.

A draft may have restricted access.

## Proposed

The *Proposed* designation indicates that the resource is ready to be [prototyped](innovation.md#prototype) and [validated](innovation.md#validate) by others and that the resource may be use in practice.

A proposed resource may stay a proposal indefinitely.  Teams may adopt a proposed resource.  

A proposed resource is a public document.

## Recommended

The *Recommended* designation indicates that the resource is complete is recommended for adoption.

## Retired

The *Retired* designation indicates that the resource is no longer recommended.
