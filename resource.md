## TL;DR

Principles, practices, guides, specifications, concepts, and archetypes are **neither dogma nor doctrine**, but rather **resources** that are discovered in innovative implementations, are promoted and adopted to drive further innovation, and are constantly evolving.

## Discovery

Resources are not created, but rather discovered in successful real world implementations.  Resources are recommended to othes to help innovate and interoperate.

## Adoption

Resources are not prescribed, but recommended for adoption.  It is everyone's responsibility to fully assess the characteristics of a project or product along with the strategies of the organization to decide what resources should be adopted.

## Publication

Anyone or group may freely publish resources or make recommendations for new or modified resources.

## Evolution

Resources are not static, but evolve as they are adopted, in part, or in whole.
